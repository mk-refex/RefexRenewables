            Since 2018, the Company has been actively engaged in the conceptualization to commercialization of solar power systems for megawatt-scale utility projects and commercial rooftop solar PV installations. The Company's portfolio includes a wide range of Solar PV power plants, including industrial and commercial rooftop systems, ground-mounted installations, and projects for land-owning farmers. It holds the distinction of being the first to execute Solar PV plants designed specifically to supply renewable traction power along railway tracks for Indian Railways. Today, it is actively involved across all dimensions of renewable energy, including emerging technologies such as battery energy storage systems.

            A few notable clients of the Company include Indian Railways, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL), Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL), Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL), Lumax, and RSPL. Among its landmark accomplishments is the design and development of the largest solar power plant for Indian Railways, established in Bhilai. A significant highlight in RRIL's journey is the successful commissioning of a 1 MWp solar power project with 2 MWh battery storage for the Indian Army in Leh, Ladakh - one of the most geographically and climatically challenging regions in the Country.
